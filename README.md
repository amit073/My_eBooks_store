# My_eBooks_store            
Worked on the backend development of a new portal using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS &MySQL database. I developed a full stack web portal that allows the user to upload or download any other book PDFs with the common database. User can also modify their search using book name and more precisely with Author's name too. User can also make an announcement for their hardcopy book to be sold and they can buy also book.
